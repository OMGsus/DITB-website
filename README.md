<h2>
Layout
</h2>
Every HTML file has a name of [name].html. This is not the format used on the Apache server. The proper name for each file is index.html, although they've been renamed for simplicity. To find the actual directory of the site that uses that html, type it in your address bar as so:

<i>www.dankinthebank.com/<b>[nameofHTMLfile]</b>/</i>

For example, donate.html would be located at: <i>www.dankinthebank.com/donate/</i>.
